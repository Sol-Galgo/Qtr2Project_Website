                <span><h1 class="titleproduct">AMX 13 105</h1></span>
                <p class="description">
                    It is a variant of the AMX 13 French light tank, with its modified 
                    FL 12 turret equipped with a 105-mm gun mounted on it. As production of the tank halted around the 20th century, 
                    we replicated the model as well as its individual parts using the blueprints that the top officials of the military 
                    that's based in France have given us (the specific details are not stated and are considered to be classified information).
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Its main armament is equipped with an autoloader, it has really good top speed of 68km/h and an amazing engine power, which makes this tank 
                    able to easily traverse even the roughest terrain. It is also equipped with an amazing view range, and its low 
                    silhouette makes it difficult to get spotted by the enemy, especially if it's using camo. Although its armor is quite 
                    mediocre, even small-caliber guns can penetrate through it. This tank is best used for scouting missions and light infantry 
                    support due to its view range and small design.

                <span><h1 class="titleproduct">Type 59</h1></span>
                <p class="description">
                    This tank was ought to be the Chinese-produced version of the Soviet T-54A tank. The turret is mounted with a 100 mm 
                    cannon as its main armament, with an additional 7.62 mm machine gun and a 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun. Even though
                    its production ended in 1985, approximately 10,000 individual tanks have been produced since the beginning of its production 
                    in 1958. Our company tries to restore the already existing Type 59 tanks and attempts to replicate and reproduce these tanks with 
                    the permission of the top officials of the Chinese military and the government (the specific details are not stated and are considered 
                    to be classified information).
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The Type 59 has solid frontal armor with an angled hull that makes it capable enough to deflect certain shells and a rounded turret that's 
                    basically impervious to some tanks. It's also quite nimble, with a top speed of 60 km/h and an amazing hull traverse with an average of 46 degrees 
                    per second. Unfortunately, as this tank is based off of a Russian design, its maximum gun depression only sits at around -4°. In comparison, the 
                    usual gun depression of most British and American tanks sits at around -8° to -10°. Which makes it almost impossible to use in ridge lines and 
                    hilly terrain. This tank is best used for frontal engagements and urban warfare, as most terrains are usually flat in an urban setting.

                <span><h1 class="titleproduct">Tortoise</h1></span>
                <p class="description">
                    It is an assault tank destroyer developed by Britain that was based on the design 
                    of the AT 15, which was also designed by Britain. The largest caliber gun that it can 
                    mount is the 120 mm AT L1A1 gun, which is the gun that we mounted on the tank. As 
                    only a total of five Tortoise tanks were developed during its production process, 
                    we were able to replicate the design and the parts of the tank using the blueprints 
                    given to us by the top officials of the British military (the specific details are
                    not stated and are classified information).
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The Tortoise boasts incredibly thick armor both on its front and on its sides, 
                    which increases the tank's survivability on the battlefield. Literally, almost 
                    every WW2 and even Cold War-era tank that faces this tank will have a difficult time penetrating 
                    it. Although it has really good armor, its downside is really awful mobility. Coupled with a horrible 
                    top speed of 20 km/h and awful engine power, it can definitely take quite a while to reach the 
                    battlefield. This tank is well suited for the frontline, more specifically frontal engagements 
                    against enemy tanks.

                <span><h1 class="titleproduct">M60</h1></span>
                <p class="description">
                    The M60 was considered the primary main battle tank (MBT) of the United States during 
                    the Cold War. It ought to be the modernized version of its descendant, the M48 Patton. 
                    The turret is equipped with a 105-mm M68 gun. The tank first went into production around 1959, 
                    and around 15,000 copies of this tank were developed. Our company aims to restore these tanks 
                    and replace the broken equipment to our best extent, with collaboration with the US military,
                    in order to ensure that these tanks will be effective on the battlefield.

                    This beast is equipped with amazing firepower, a sloped frontal hull, and a rounded turret 
                    that would provide maximum efficiency on the battlefield. It's also got pretty good mobility with 
                    60 km/h top speed, making it able to zoom in on the battlefield. Not to mention, its huge cupola 
                    also gives the tank an amazing view range that would help the crew members spot enemy targets much
                    easier. This tank's sole purpose is to be an all-round vehicle that can be used in most situations 
                    against other vehicles during its time, hence the term “main battle tank"

                <p class="description">
                    This vehicle isn't really considered a tank based on its definition,
                    but a self-propelled artillery that's widely used in the United 
                    States. It has a 155 mm M126 howitzer and an additional .50 caliber
                    M2 machine gun mounted on it. As it is still being produced to 
                    this day, we collaborate with various military companies that produce this 
                    vehicle to sell this product and to ensure its quality on the battlefield.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    As this vehicle is a self-propelled artillery, this tank would not be well 
                    suited on the frontline of the battlefield when engaging against enemy vehicles. Instead, 
                    to maximize its efficiency on the battlefield, we can use this vehicle as support artillery.
                    Situated at the very back of the battlefield, aiming at the enemy vehicles on the frontline.

                <p class="description">
                    Tired of using the lame old 90 mm and 105 mm gun on the T49 and the 
                    XM551 Sheridan respectively? Why not spice things up and mount the big
                    152 mm Gun Launcher XM81 instead. It does come with a small price of 
                    making the tank a little bit sluggish due to the gun's weight. It might
                    even make you more susceptible to the enemy tanks spotting you after firing
                    its loud gun. But wouldn't you like just demolishing the enemy vehicles
                    with a 152 mm shell?

                    Want to have a way of communicating with your allies during battle? Why not 
                    install a dedicated radio signal for your tank! The radio signal will help you 
                    coordinate with you allies much better providing a way of strategizing and
                    relaying valuable information regarding the positions of your allies and

                    Is your tank too slow on the battlefield? Is it too difficult to retreat
                    when the enemy team is hard pushing the frontline? Or are you just an advocate
                    for speedy tanks and you enjoy zooming in through the battlefield? Why not slap
                    in some turbo charger on your engine. It gives the tank better speed and engire power 
                    to race through the battlefield much faster and your teamates won't get angry at you
                    for arriving late.

                    Does it ruin your accuracy when the tank moves so much? Are you always in a hurry

                    will solve all those problems for you. It lessens the dispersion of the tank while
                    moving or turning the turret by stabilizing the gun, making it much easier to aim at 
                    your target.
